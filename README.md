# Welcome to LPM
## Description:
LPM is a open-source free to use packaging software made in Batch for Lua. LPM was made for fun by Yaumama and isn't meant to be something too big. Get started by downloading LPM [here](https://lpm.yaumama.repl.co) and follow all installation instructions. Then run `lpm help` for a list of commands.

## Requirements

Windows is required to run LPM. Does not work on Linux or Mac.

## Contact:
You can contact Yaumama on discord: Yaumama#4685  

## Usage:
LPM is completely open source and free to use.  

## Why github?
I am using github because it is the best place to post open source things, and I will be posting pre-release versions of LPM.
